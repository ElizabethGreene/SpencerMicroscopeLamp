v0.1 - This is an ALPHA release, and known bugs exist.

A 3D printable Lamp for an American Optics Spencer Microscope

## Safety warning
This printable is designed for use only with an LED bulb of 3 watts or less.  If a halogen bulb or higher wattage bulb is used, the 3-D printed plastic will melt onto the hot bulb, catch on fire, and cause inestimable damage. Please, I beg you, for the sake of humanity, do not do this.
